# 🌌 AstroSounds

**Experience the cosmos through sound and interaction.**  
AstroSounds is a mobile app designed to make astronomy more **accessible, interactive, and deeply personal**. Whether you're a visual learner, a dreamer, or someone who sees the universe differently — this app brings the stars within reach.

## ✨ About the App

AstroSounds was created from a simple belief:  
> *Space should be felt, not just studied.*

This iOS application transforms astronomy into an immersive experience with two key features:

- **🔭 Learn Mode**:  
  Explore astronomical concepts using **Augmented Reality**. Visualize planets and stars in 3D, interact with them, and learn through intuitive lessons that make science fun and simple — especially for beginners.

- **🎶 Sound Mode**:  
  AstroSounds makes the cosmos audible by generating **melodies from celestial coordinates**. Users can "listen" to black holes, galaxies, and stars — a feature designed especially to empower **visually impaired users** and offer a new sensory experience of the universe.
